**HELLO!**

My name is Aileen and welcome to my Github profile page!  This is a work in progress and very simple at this point, but I will be updating this README and my profile page as I learn.  I am currently a student of MIT xPRO working on a professional certificate in Full Stack Development with MERN.

**ROADMAP**

In the future, I would like to update my profile page to be more personal, interesting and colorful.  I will add a list of and links to my various projects to showcase the skills I have learned.  I will also personalize it with a short biography and my future goals.
